# Prep+Eat release notes

What shipped in each build, in the App Store's "What's New" voice, so there
is always something ready to post. Started 2026-08-03 – earlier builds are
reconstructed from the backlog and git history.

> **IN REVIEW: 1.0.0** (build 12) · **NEXT VERSION: 1.1.0** · `app.json` still
> says 1.0.0, correctly – it is bumped at submission, not now.
>
> Thomas does not track the number; keeping these two lines true is Claude's
> job (agreed 2026-08-03). The rule below decides the next number, so this is
> bookkeeping, not a judgement: re-read it whenever a change is added under
> "Accumulating", and raise it if what landed outranks it – a feature turns a
> pending 1.0.1 into 1.1.0, and it never goes back down within one release.

## Versioning – Semantic Versioning (Thomas, 2026-08-03)

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, in `app.json`'s `expo.version`. Semver was written for
libraries, where MAJOR means "I broke your code" – an app has no callers to
break, so the digits are defined here in the app's own terms, otherwise the
rule decides nothing:

- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) – fixes and polish. Nothing new to do, nothing
  moved. A user who never reads notes should not notice anything except that
  something stopped being broken.
- **MINOR** (1.0.1 → 1.1.0) – a new capability. Anything that would be worth a
  sentence in the App Store notes because the user can now do something they
  could not before.
- **MAJOR** (1.x → 2.0.0) – a release existing users have to re-learn: a
  redesign, a change to what the app is for, a paid tier. Rare, and a
  deliberate decision rather than a consequence of a big diff.

The version is NOT the build number. EAS auto-increments builds (12, 13, …)
and many builds can sit under one version – build 12 and build 13 are both
"1.0.0". Only bump `expo.version` when preparing a release to submit; Apple
requires it to increase between releases, not between builds.

**A migration has no version.** It is live for every version at once the
moment it runs, so it can never appear in a version's notes. That is why
server changes have their own section at the bottom of this file.

Two more rules this file exists to keep straight:

1. **A build is not a release.** A build reaching TestFlight is not a build
   users have. v1.0 in App Store review is bound to build 12 and nothing
   shipped since then is in it.
2. **Database changes are not in any build.** Migrations reach every phone
   the moment they run, whatever version it is on. They are listed
   separately below for that reason.

## Accumulating toward the next version

More goes in before this ships, so this section grows. On the dev build only:
not on TestFlight, not in review, and it needs a build to reach anyone.

**This will be 1.1.0** under the rule above – a new capability (moving
leftovers between weeks, and now ingredient sections) alongside the fixes, and
a feature makes it MINOR. It stays unnumbered in `app.json` until it is
actually being prepared for submission, and v1.0.0 has to be approved and
released first either way.

- **Drag a section and its ingredients come with it.** Moving "DOUGH" now moves
  everything under it, instead of leaving the ingredients behind. A section
  drops between other sections rather than into the middle of one, so nothing
  changes section without you asking. Dragging a single ingredient works exactly
  as before – that is still how you move one into another section.
- **Editing a section no longer turns it into an ingredient.** Opening a
  heading to edit it and pressing Done used to save it as an ordinary
  ingredient – which then appeared on your shopping list. Headings stay
  headings.
- **Tap a row to edit it.** While editing a recipe, tapping anywhere on an
  ingredient or instruction opens it, instead of having to find the three dots
  first. Deleting has moved into that same sheet, so every row is edited and
  removed in one place.
- **The edit sheet behaves itself.** It no longer opens so tall that the close
  button is off screen, it uses more of the screen when it needs to, and it no
  longer throws the keyboard at you when you are only editing – so you can see
  the whole thing and choose what you came to change.
- **Reordering no longer jumps when you let go.** Anything you drop now settles
  where you put it. This affected every reorder list – ingredients, instructions
  and shopping categories – and had done since reordering was built.

## Build 16 – TestFlight 2026-08-06 (VALID, not in review)

Uploaded 22:03 CEST, VALID three minutes later. Everything that had
accumulated since build 15 on 2026-08-04. **Needs migration 0031**, which was
applied to production the same evening – the sections would be invisible
without it.

- **Recipes can have sections now.** A recipe that groups its ingredients –
  Dough, Filling, Frosting – keeps those headings instead of listing them as
  things to buy, and they no longer turn up on your shopping list. Imported
  recipes get their sections automatically; you can also add, rename and delete
  your own.
- Reordering ingredients has a new look, and shows your sections while you
  drag, so you can see what you are moving.
- Every sheet in the app – add ingredient, add meal, edit item, invite someone –
  now has the same corners and spacing. They had drifted apart.



## Build 15 – TestFlight 2026-08-04 (VALID, not in review)

Uploaded 09:08 and confirmed VALID by asking App Store Connect directly. **v1.0
is still bound to build 12 and untouched**, so these reach testers without
disturbing the review queue – the same call as builds 13 and 14.

- Amounts read properly whatever the serving count: "1 liter" and "2 liters",
  not "1 liters" or "2 liter". Danish units too.
- An app left open or asleep over Sunday midnight now knows it is a new week,
  and marks the right day as today. Before, it could still be showing last
  week, so a meal added to what looked like this week landed on the finished
  one.
- Imported recipes read properly: no more "chef&rsquo;s" or "cr&egrave;me" in
  the middle of a title, and a recipe written with "½" keeps its amount instead
  of losing it off the shopping list.
- Switching week on the shopping list can no longer leave the wrong week's
  items under the right week's heading.

## Build 14 – TestFlight 2026-08-03 (VALID, not in review)

Uploaded 17:06. Cut from the code as it stood at 15:39, so anything committed
after that is still in "Accumulating" above.

- **Move last week's leftovers to this week.** A past week's shopping list
  that still has unchecked items gets a "Move all items to this week"
  button. Items that were not bought move onto the current week instead of
  being re-added by hand, merging into anything already there rather than
  making a second line. Undo puts both weeks back.
- The shopping list checkbox sits level with the item name again, instead of
  drifting into the gap under it on rows with an amount.

## Build 13 – TestFlight 2026-08-03 (VALID, not in review)

**These are NOT in v1.0.** v1.0 was deliberately left bound to build 12
rather than disturb the review queue, so they need a 1.0.1 once v1.0 is
approved and released.

- An imported recipe is no longer lost when its photo cannot be fetched, and
  a save that fails now says so instead of failing quietly.
- "Try again" where loading could fail: the Recipes tab, recipe detail and
  the shopping week switch. Shopping also gained a loading spinner it never
  had, so switching week no longer looks like nothing happened.
- The household invite code is legible (it failed contrast before).

## Build 12 – TestFlight 2026-07-30, **submitted for App Store review 2026-07-31**

This is v1.0 – the version in review, and the only one the public will get
at launch.

- The Plan tab recovers from a failed load instead of sitting empty.
- The household switcher is obvious, and you can create a new household from
  it.
- Recipe import handles fraction ranges, dangling clauses and "1 cups".
- A recipe with no ingredients is no longer imported as an empty shell.
- Five small UI fixes across household, recipes and shopping.

## Server changes (live for everyone, no build needed)

- **2026-08-07 – migration 0033.** Guessing an invite code is now genuinely
  limited: the app allows 30 join attempts an hour in total and refuses the
  rest. **Nothing changes for anyone using a code they were given.** The limit
  that was supposed to do this before turned out never to have worked at all –
  every failed guess undid its own record – so until today there was nothing
  stopping someone trying codes until one landed them in a stranger's
  household. **Live for everyone including v1.0's build 12.**
  If a join is ever refused with "Too many tries", waiting an hour clears it.

- **2026-08-07 – migration 0032.** Security hardening around joining and
  leaving a household. **Nothing changes on screen** – this closes two ways the
  app's own rules could be side-stepped by talking to the server directly
  instead of through the app: an account could be left in no household at all
  (skipping the recipe copy you are entitled to when you leave), and an invite
  code could be created that never expired. Leaving, deleting an account and
  creating an invite code now have exactly one route each.
  **Live for everyone including v1.0's build 12.** No user-facing line needed
  when this ships – there is nothing for a reader to notice, which is the point.

- **2026-08-04 – migration 0030.** Clearing the done
  items no longer stops the above from working: change a meal afterwards and
  what you still need shows up as usual. Before this it went quiet again.
  **Live for everyone including v1.0's build 12.**
- **2026-08-04 – migration 0029.** Change a meal
  after you have been through the list and anything you still need shows up as
  its own line, with just the extra amount on it – the things you already ticked
  off stay ticked off. Before this, nothing happened at all (and briefly, with
  0028 below, it asked for the whole amount again instead of the difference).
- **2026-08-04 – migration 0028.** Superseded by 0029 the same day. Raise a
  recipe's servings and the ticked-off ingredients came back with the new
  TOTAL, which overstates what is left to buy. **Live for everyone including
  v1.0's build 12** until 0029 runs.

- **2026-08-03 – migration 0027.** "1 liter milk" and "2 liters milk" become
  one line on the shopping list again, along with jars, containers and
  pinches. **Live for everyone including v1.0's build 12.** Applies to weeks
  planned from now on; a list that already shows an item twice keeps showing
  it twice until that week is rebuilt.
- **2026-08-03 – migration 0026.** Adds the move/undo functions the leftover
  move calls. Live, but unreachable until the app half ships, so no phone
  behaves differently yet.
- **2026-08-03 – migration 0025.** A shopping line can no longer be debited
  more than it was credited: checking an item off around a plan change used
  to leave its amount wrong. **Live for everyone including v1.0's build 12.**
