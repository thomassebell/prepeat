# Ship the most recent finished EAS build to TestFlight. No rebuild.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/eas-submit-ios.sh
#
# Run this AFTER ./scripts/eas-build-ios.sh has finished. It uploads the
# latest build; the .ipa already exists, so this is just the upload.
#
# WATCHDOG (2026-07-23): the actual upload runs on Expo's servers and the
# command only watches. Once, that server-side submission wedged and the
# command sat on "Submitting" for 90 minutes with no error. So this script
# caps the wait: if the submit prints nothing for STALL_LIMIT seconds the local
# watcher is killed rather than hanging forever.
#
# WHAT A WATCHDOG KILL DOES NOT MEAN (2026-08-04, build 15): that nothing
# shipped. The submission had not even started uploading – it was IN QUEUE on
# Expo's servers, which is silent, so ten minutes of no output was normal. This
# script used to print "Nothing shipped" there, which is not knowable from this
# end. It now prints what `eas submit:list` and Apple actually say, because the
# right next move differs completely: "in queue" means wait, "errored" means
# retry. Retrying a queued submission only adds a duplicate.
#
# The run then ends by asking App Store Connect directly whether the build is
# VALID (scripts/asc-build-state.mjs) – added 2026-07-25 after `eas submit`
# was seen spinning long AFTER a successful upload as well as during a stuck
# one. Apple's answer is the only trustworthy one.
