/**
 * "Move all items to this week" – the action on a past week's list (Figma
 * 434:7148 "transfer items from last week", designed 2026-08-03).
 *
 * Only rendered on a PAST week that still has unchecked items: the current
 * week has nowhere to push to, and a week that was fully bought has nothing
 * to push.
 *
 * PINNED above the tab bar rather than ending the scrolling content (Thomas,
 * 2026-08-03). The frame shows a short week, where the button sits at the
 * bottom of the list area either way – but a week with twenty leftovers would
 * have hidden it below the fold, which is the same trap the recipe Save
 * button fell into on a long recipe (2026-07-28). This is that same footer:
 * a top border and the screen's own background, so rows scroll under it
 * instead of showing through.
 *
 * Pressed is the DS's `button/solid/fill/pressed` – React Native inherits no
 * press feedback of its own, and states live on the DS component rather than
 * on each frame that uses it.
